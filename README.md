# GEEBRA

GEEBRA (General Estimating Equations with or without Bias-Reducing Adjustments; pronounced `zeeÂ·
bruh`) is a Julia package that provides infrastructure to estimate statistical models by solving estimating equations or by maximizing inference objectives, like the likelihood functions, using user-specified templates. A key feature is the option to adjust the estimating equation or penalize the objectives in order to reduce the bias of the resulting estimators. 

The only requirements from the user are to:
1. implement a [Julia composite type](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/types/index.html) for the data;
2. implement a function for calculating a contribution to the estimating function or to the objective function that has arguments the parameter vector, the data object, and the observation index;
3. implement a function for computing the number of observations from the data object;
4. specify a GEEBRA template (using `geebra_ef_templace` for estimating functions and `geebra_obj_templace` for objective function) that has fields the functions for computing the contributions to the estimating functions or to the objective, and the number of observations.

GEEBRA, then, provides methods to estimate the unknown parameters by solving the estimating equations or maximizing the inference objectives. It can also compute adjustments to the estimating functions or penalties to the objective for reducing the bias of the resulting estimators. The calculation of the adjustment is done internally, using forward mode automatic differentiation (AD), as implemented in [ForwardDiff](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ForwardDiff.jl), and requires no further work from the user.
