## Package description

**GEEBRA** is a Julia package that provides infrastructure to estimate
statistical models by solving estimating equations or by maximizing
inference objectives, like the likelihood functions, using
user-specified templates.

A key feature is the option to adjust the estimating equation or
penalize the objectives in order to reduce the bias of the resulting
estimators.

## M-estimation and bias reduction

**GEEBRA** has been designed so that the only requirements from the user are to:
1. implement a [Julia composite type](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/types/index.html) for the data;
2. implement a function for computing the number of observations from the data object;
3. implement a function for calculating the contribution to the estimating function or to the objective function from a single observation that has arguments the parameter vector, the data object, and the observation index;
4. specify a GEEBRA template (using [`estimating_function_template`](@ref) for estimating functions and [`objective_function_template`](@ref) for objective function) that has fields the functions for computing the contributions to the estimating functions or to the objective, and the number of observations.

**GEEBRA**, then, can estimate the unknown parameters by solving the estimating equations or maximizing the inference objectives. 

There is also the option to compute bias-reducing adjustments to the estimating functions or bias-reducing penalties to the objective to compute estimators with improved bias properties.  The bias-reducing adjustments and penalties are formed internally from the supplied templates and data object, using forward mode automatic differentiation, as implemented in [**ForwardDiff**](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ForwardDiff.jl). No further work or input is required by the user.
